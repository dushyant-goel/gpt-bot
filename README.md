This integrates OpenAI's APIs into a fun project.

### How to use?
Create a file `.env` in root of the project and add line:

`API_KEY=<Your OpenAI API key>`

Then, the usual:
```
npm install
npm start
```

The server is listening on `http://localhost:3000`

See file `/routes/api.js` for API routes.
